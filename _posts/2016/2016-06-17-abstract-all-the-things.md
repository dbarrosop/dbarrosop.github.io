A couple of weeks ago I made this presentation/demo about abstractions for network operations titled "Abstract all the Things". The idea was to show how templating is good but not good enough, sometimes you have to step back and focus on the goal and not on how to get there. Well, if you are interested in the topic you can find below the video, the link to the templates and to the github repo where you can find all the code I used for the demo.
