With the New Year new challenges come. In addition to keep working on the cool projects I have working on during 2015 ([napalm][napalm], [sir][sir], [pyfg][pyfg] and many [others][github]) I plan to work on some other cool ideas I have in mind (more on this soon). I also plan to try to blog a bit about what I am doing, ideas, architectures, etc... We will see how it goes.
